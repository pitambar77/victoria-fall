          BABOHI is a distinguished lodge exclusively for adults, topped with
          excellent dining and polished service. This highly modern and inviting
          retreat displays earthy tones, wooden finishes and warm fabrics that
          merge with modern coppers, marble finishes and sophisticated hues that
          allude to the African skies.
